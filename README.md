![easy](https://badgen.net/badge/Difficulty/Easy/green)

Technologies: Python 3

## Description

Currently we have a program that read a list of transactions from a CSV file, and shows them in a pretty format
within the terminal. We want to add a functionality where we can also display the total for all transactions at the end.

## Get Started

// TODO: Add more clear instructions.

To get started, first fork this repository. After forking the repository, you would want to work within a separate branch.

## Run the Project

## Requirements

- After running `app.py` and specifying a CSV file, user should be able to see the transaction total in addition to all transaction details.
- No unit tests required.
